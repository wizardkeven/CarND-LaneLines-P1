### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

#### 1. First version for solidWhiteRight and solidYellowLeft

The first version for my pipeline consisted of 5 steps:
*Convert the images to grayscale
*Apply Gaussian smoothing
*Apply Canny for color filter
*Apply region selection
*Run Hough on edge detected image
*Create a "color" binary image to combine with line image


In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...
